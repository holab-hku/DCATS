Description: Methods to detect the differential composition abundances between 
    conditions in singel-cell RNA-seq experiments, with or without replicates. 
    It aims to correct bias introduced by missclaisification and enable 
    controlling of confounding covariates. To avoid the influence of proportion 
    change from big cell types, DCATS can use either total cell number or 
    specific reference group as normalization term.
